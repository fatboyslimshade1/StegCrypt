# StegCrypt
Encryption Using Steganography 
The target of this venture is to obtain secured encryption and authentication using steganography. So as to accomplish this, numerous organizations & universities in the world have given solutions to secured communication, in the interim many algorithms have been created, including like AES, RSA, LSB etc. But though these algorithms have been developed they were endured to breakdown by hackers which make them obsolete. In this paper we try to combine many already existing algorithms like AES, LSB into one proposed system. Firstly, the utilization of steganography along with traditional encryption is implemented in the proposed system. Second, we try to achieve authentication of user using OTP via E-mail. Thirdly, the encrypted data is divided and sent across many servers so itâ€™s impossible to get complete encrypted data in one path. By applying the proposed model, the probability of data compromise becomes very minimal and very hard to hack.
